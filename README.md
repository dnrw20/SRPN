# Saturated Reverse Polish Notation
(SRPN) Calculator
Whilst performing some maintenance on a legacy system you find that it
makes use of a program called SRPN (srpn). SRPN is not documented
and no one seems to know who wrote it, so your boss tells you to rewrite it
in Python.
SRPN is a reverse polish notation calculator with the extra feature
that all arithmetic is saturated i.e. when it reaches the maximum value that
can be stored in a variable, it stays at the maximum rather than wrapping
around.
Your task is to write a program, which matches the functionality of SRPN as closely as possible. Note that this includes not
adding or enhancing existing features
